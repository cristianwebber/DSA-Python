# Data Structures and Algorithms - Python

This repository contains the implementation of the algorithms from the [The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/) course from @ThePrimeagen in Python. The algorithms are implemented from scratch in order to understand the inner workings of each algorithm. Besides that, I also added some different implementations using Python features and some benchmarks.

## Algorithms

The course covers the following algorithms:

* Sorting algorithms:
  * Bubble Sort
  * Quick Sort
* Search algorithms:
  * Linear Search
  * Binary Search
  * Depth-first Search
  * Breadth-first Search
* Graph algorithms:
  * Graph Representation
  * Dijkstra's Algorithm
* Data Structures:
  * Linked List
  * Stack
  * Queue
  * Priority Queue (Heap)
  * Tries
  * Binary Search Tree
* Extra:
  * Two Crystal Balls
  * Recursion (Path Finding)
  * Performance benchmark of lists and deques in Python
  * Deque for multithreads
  * LRU Cache
